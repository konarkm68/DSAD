# Data Structures in DSAD
This repository provides implementations of various fundamental data structures in different programming languages.

Here's a quick overview of what you'll find:

Linear Data Structures:

Arrays:
Static arrays: Fixed-size collections of elements accessed by index.
Dynamic arrays: Resizable arrays that can grow or shrink as needed.
Linked Lists:
Singly Linked Lists: Linear data structures where each element (node) points to the next node in the list.
Doubly Linked Lists: Similar to singly linked lists, but each node also has a pointer to the previous node.
Stacks:
Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structures where elements are added and removed from the top.
Implementations using both arrays and linked lists.
Queues:
First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structures where elements are added at the back and removed from the front.
Implementations using both arrays and linked lists.
Non-Linear Data Structures:

Trees:
Hierarchical data structures where nodes have parent-child relationships.
Various types of trees are implemented, including binary search trees (BSTs) and AVL trees.
Graphs:
Collections of nodes (vertices) connected by edges.
Implementations of different graph traversal algorithms.
Additional Structures:

Hash Tables:
Efficient data structures for storing key-value pairs.
Implemented using various hashing techniques.
This repository serves as a valuable resource for learning and practicing the implementation of various data structures in different programming languages.

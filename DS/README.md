## Data Structures in DSAD

This repository provides implementations of various fundamental data structures in different programming languages.

Here's a quick overview of what you'll find:

1. Linear:
    1. Static
        (Arrays)[]: Fixed-size collections of elements accessed by index.
        <TODO><!--2. Dynamic arrays: Resizable arrays that can grow or shrink as needed.-->
    2. Dynamic
        1. (Linked Lists)[]:
            1. Singly-Linked-Lists: Linear Data Structures where each element (node) points to the next node in the list.
            2. Doubly-Linked-Lists: Similar to singly linked lists, but each node also has a pointer to the previous node.
        2. (Stacks)[]: Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structures where elements are added and removed from the top.
            Implementations using both arrays and linked lists.
        3. (Queues)[]: First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structures where elements are added at the back and removed from the front.
            Implementations using both arrays and linked lists.

2. Non-Linear:
    <TODO>
    <!--1. Trees: Hierarchical data structures where nodes have parent-child relationships.
        Various types of trees are implemented, including binary search trees (BSTs) and AVL trees.
    2. Graphs: Collections of nodes (vertices) connected by edges.
        Implementations of different graph traversal algorithms.-->

This repository serves as a valuable resource for learning and practicing the implementation of various data structures in different programming languages.
